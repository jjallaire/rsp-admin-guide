# Getting Started

RStudio Server enables you to provide a browser based interface (the RStudio IDE) to a version of R running on a remote Linux server. Deploying R and RStudio on a server has a number of benefits, including:

- The ability to access R sessions from any computer in any location;
- Easy sharing of code, data, and other files with colleagues;
- Allowing multiple users to share access to the more powerful compute resources (memory, processors, etc.) available on a well equipped server; and
- Centralized installation and configuration of R, R packages, TeX, and other supporting libraries.

This manual describes *RStudio Server Professional Edition*, which adds many enhancements to the open-source version of RStudio Server, including:

- The ability to run multiple concurrent R sessions per-user.
- Flexible use of multiple versions of R on the same server.
- Project sharing for easy collaboration within workgroups.
- Load balancing for increased capacity and higher availability.
- An administrative dashboard that provides insight into active sessions, server health, and monitoring of system-wide and per-user performance and resource metrics;
- Authentication using system accounts, ActiveDirectory, LDAP, or Google Accounts;
- Full support for PAM (including PAM sessions for dynamically provisioning user resources);
- Ability to establish per-user or per-group CPU priorities and memory limits;
- HTTP enhancements including support for SSL and keep-alive for improved performance;
- Ability to restrict access to the server by IP;
- Customizable server health checks; and
- Suspend, terminate, or assume control of user sessions; Impersonate users for assistance and troubleshooting.
